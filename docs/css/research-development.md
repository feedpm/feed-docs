### Designing for screen reader compatibility

Screen readers convert digital text into synthesized speech. They empower users to hear content and navigate with the keyboard. The technology helps people who are blind or who have low vision to use information technology with the same level of independence and privacy as anyone else. Screen readers are also used by people with certain cognitive or learning disabilities, or users who simply prefer audio content over text.

In the context of a website, your screen reader might be halfway through reading you a list of 50 sidebar links when you start wondering if there is any valuable content on the site at all.

Experiences like this are caused by websites that are built with layouts that are only visual. Ideally, however, our visual layouts should point to an underlying organizational model of our content. They should be visual indicators for a conceptual model. The visual indicators are just one way of revealing this model. The Web Accessibility Initiative’s ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) project provides alternative indicators to users who may need them.

### Clipping and Masking in CSS

Masking in image editing is a method of ‘hiding’ a portion of an object based on another object. This method has long been available in Image editors like Photoshop. A similar method can also be done in CSS with some of its properties.

The clip-path CSS property creates a clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. Parts that are inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.

### CSS for asymmetrical layouts

Designers have been implementing grids to ensure that their page layouts appear beautiful and instantly drive user attention, with dynamic effects. But now, it is time to break the monotony and introduce something beyond the grid. This is being achieved by breaking the grid. It might not be easy to get rid of the grid entirely since it has already become a norm over the internet. It has been playing an important role in offering a distinct and beautiful experience to the users, enhancing a brand’s prominence and thereby bolstering conversions.

This is where an asymmetrical layout can be thought about – for organizing text, irregular shapes, and image overlapping. The realistic effect will bloom within your site with no compromise over the functionality part.

### AMP

Accelerated Mobile Page (or AMP, for short) is a project from Google and Twitter designed to make really fast mobile pages. At its essence, it's basically a stripped-down form of HTML.

Fundamentally, it's an HTML page designed to be super lightweight and critically designs really fast loading. So Google, Twitter, a bunch of other companies have rolled this out — kind of in response to projects like the Facebook Instant Articles project from Facebook and Apple News and so forth. This is designed to be the open response. So it's open source, and there are all kinds of elements of openness to the project.
